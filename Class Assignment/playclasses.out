Step 1
Object a has w = 11 = 2
Object b has w = 21 = 4

Step 2-3A
playclass1 l = 7.8 w = 5.3
playclass2 l = 21 w = 10.5

Step 3A, 3B
This is the area of a rectangle x = 41.34
This is the area of a rectangle y = 220.5

Step 3C, 3D
This is the area of a rectangle a = 11.25
This is the area of a rectangle b = 79.4375
